# Project MindSpace
<br/>

This is a minimalistic To-Do application written in Java 9 using JavaFX that helps you organize all the tasks you planned from now on.

Change the priority, the due date, the repetition of your tasks and move them around just as you want.

All you have to do is make up a header for it!
